# Cobalt
# Private server for latest does not work because of EOS
SSL Bypass for Fortnite.<br>
Hopefully when I have a lot of time I'll make a new SSL Bypass with a BUNCH of features.

# the rewrite was very simple not much was changed.
# Changing port or ip.

Go to `settings.h` and change URL_HOST and URL_PORT to what you want.

# Enabling hybrid

Go to `settings.h` and change the variable `CobaltUsage` to `ECobaltUsage::Hybrid`.

# Recording requests on latest

[Download LawinServerV1](https://github.com/Lawin0129/LawinServer) and run `install_packages.bat` and then `start.bat`.<br><br>
In Cobalt, change the mode to hybrid ([tutorial](https://github.com/Milxnor/Cobalt#enabling-hybrid)) and make sure `URL_HOST` is `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and `URL_PORT` is 3551 (default LawinServerV1 port) in `settings.h`.

## How to have Fiddler and connect to XMPP and matchmaker

Thanks [Lawin](https://github.com/Lawin0129) for this method.<br>
Go to the `CloudStorage` folder in your LawinServerV1 and open `DefaultEngine.ini` and change it to

```
[OnlineSubsystemMcp.Xmpp]
ServerAddr="ws://xmpp-service-prod.ol.epicgames.com"
Protocol=ws
bUseSSL=false

[OnlineSubsystemMcp.Xmpp Prod]
ServerAddr="ws://xmpp-service-prod.ol.epicgames.com"
Protocol=ws
bUseSSL=false
```

Put this into your FiddlerScript.

```
import Fiddler;

class Handlers
{
    static function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session) {
        if (oSession.hostname.StartsWith("xmpp-service")) 
        {
            oSession.oRequest.headers.UriScheme = "https";
        }
        if (oSession.hostname.StartsWith("fortnite-matchmaking")) 
        {
            oSession.oRequest.headers.UriScheme = "https";
        }
        if (oSession.hostname.StartsWith("fortnite-mm")) 
        {
            oSession.oRequest.headers.UriScheme = "https";
        }
    }
        
    static function OnBeforeResponse(oSession: Session) {
        oSession.utilReplaceInResponse("wss://", "ws://");
    }
}
```

## Launching latest

Go to your Win64 folder of latest, replace `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_BE.exe`, `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_EAC.exe`, and `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_EAC_EOS.exe` with `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`.<br>

Launch Fiddler, and when you get the error, inject Cobalt and then you should load in lobby a few seconds later.
